## Physicall model for AGN feedback; Radio Semi-Analytic Galaxy Evolution (Radio-SAGE)

SAGE is a publicly available codebase for modelling galaxy formation in a cosmological context. It is a significant update to that used in [Croton et al. (2006)](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0508046) and has been rebuilt to be modular and customisable. SAGE will run on any N-body simulation whose trees are written in depth-first order and contain a minimum set of basic halo data.

A description of the model and its default calibration results can be found in [Croton et al. (2016)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04709). These calibration results can also be explored in an iPython notebook showcasing the key figures [here](https://github.com/darrencroton/sage/blob/master/output/SAGE_MM.ipynb). Galaxy formation models built using SAGE on the Millennium, Bolshoi and GiggleZ simulations can be downloaded at the [Theoretical Astrophysical Observatory (TAO)](https://tao.asvo.org.au/). You can also find SAGE on [ascl.net](http://ascl.net/code/v/1298).

We describe new efforts to model radio active galactic nuclei (AGN) in a cosmological context using the SAGE semi-analytic galaxy model. Our new method tracks the physical properties of radio jets in massive galaxies, including the evolution of radio
lobes and their impact on the surrounding gas.
