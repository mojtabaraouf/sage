## New prescription for AGN feedback (Jet-model) ; clues from Semi-Analytic Galaxy Evolution (SAGE)

SAGE is a publicly available codebase for modelling galaxy formation in a cosmological context. It is a significant update to that used in [Croton et al. (2006)](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0508046) and has been rebuilt to be modular and customisable. SAGE will run on any N-body simulation whose trees are written in depth-first order and contain a minimum set of basic halo data.

A description of the model and its default calibration results can be found in [Croton et al. (2016)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04709). These calibration results can also be explored in an iPython notebook showcasing the key figures [here](https://github.com/darrencroton/sage/blob/master/output/SAGE_MM.ipynb). Galaxy formation models built using SAGE on the Millennium, Bolshoi and GiggleZ simulations can be downloaded at the [Theoretical Astrophysical Observatory (TAO)](https://tao.asvo.org.au/). You can also find SAGE on [ascl.net](http://ascl.net/code/v/1298).

We are  using the SAGE semi analytic code for implementation of new prescription in AGN feedback.
With the better density model and same density model for both AGN jet shock driven and cooling process, the AGN jet-model modifies not just the temperature of the gas but the density profile as well.
